# Hey, ya'll. My name is Cam.
## Software Engineer with a current focus on Web Development
### I am a developer with a passion for anything tech related and an affinity for anything played on the tabletop. After getting out of the military in 2018 and working some extremely boring jobs I finally got myself back into school. After a quick associate degree, I found Hack Reactor, a brutal engineering immersive, and my love of web development. You can always find me digging into new technology and/or nerding it up on the tabletop.
